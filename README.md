# Pipeline Leak Detection with the Coral Dev Board Micro

Based on [google-coral/coralmicro-out-of-tree-sample](https://github.com/google-coral/coralmicro-out-of-tree-sample)

## To build and flash it yourself

### 1. Clone this project and submodules

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules -j8 https://github.com/having11/pipeline-leak-coral-dev-micro
```

### 2. Build the project

```bash
cd pipeline-leak-coral-dev-micro

cmake -B out -S .

make -C out -j8
```

To maximize your CPU usage, replace `-j8` with either `-j$(nproc)` on Linux or
`-j$(sysctl -n hw.ncpu)` on Mac.


### 3. Flash it to your board

```bash
python3 coralmicro/scripts/flashtool.py --build_dir out --elf_path out/coralmicro-app
```

Anytime you make changes to the code, rebuild it with the `make` command and flash it again.

**Note:** In addition to specifying the path to your project's ELF file with `elf_path`, it's
necessary to specify the build output directory with `build_dir` because flashtool needs to get
the elf_loader (bootloader) program from there.

If you followed the guide to [get started with the Dev Board
Micro](https://coral.ai/docs/dev-board-micro/get-started/), then both the `build_dir` and `elf_path`
arguments are probably new to you. That's because when flashing in-tree examples and apps (as is done
in that guide), the `build_dir` is ommitted because the flashtool uses the local `build` directory
by default. Similarly, in-tree examples and apps don't need to specify the ELF file with `elf_path`
because those files are built in the same build directoryâ€”we can instead specify just the project
name with `--example` (or `-e`) and `--app` (or `-a`) when flashing these in-tree projects.
